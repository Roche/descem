# Introduction
This document runs a discrete event simulation model using simulated individual patient data (IPD) to show how the functions can be used to generate a model when IPD from a trial is available.

# Packages and main options

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(survival)
library(survminer)

```

# Model concept
The model is represented below. All patients start in the progression-free state and may move to the progressed state. At any point in time they can die, depending on the risk of each disease stage. Patients may also experience a disease event which accelerates progression.

# Generate dummy IPD trial data and fit survival models
The dummy IPD trial data is generated below using the sim_adtte() function from the flexsurvPlus package.
Parametric survival models are fit to the dummy OS and TTP IPD. We are using the flexsurv package to fit the parametric survival models.

```{r load_data, message=FALSE}
#Generate dummy IPD
tte.df <- sim_adtte(seed = 821, rho = 0, beta_1a = log(0.6), beta_1b = log(0.6), beta_pd = log(0.2))

#Change data frame to wide format
tte.df <- tte.df %>% select(-PARAM) %>% pivot_wider(names_from = PARAMCD, values_from = c(AVAL,CNSR)) 

#Derive Time to Progression Variable from OS and PFS
tte.df <- tte.df %>% mutate(
  AVAL_TTP = AVAL_PFS,
  CNSR_TTP = ifelse(AVAL_PFS == AVAL_OS & CNSR_PFS==0 & CNSR_OS==0,1,CNSR_PFS),
  Event_OS = 1-CNSR_OS,
  Event_PFS = 1-CNSR_PFS,
  Event_TTP = 1-CNSR_TTP
  )

#Add baseline characteristics (sex and age) to time to event data
IPD <- tte.df %>% mutate(
  SEX = rbinom(500,1,0.5),
  AGE = rnorm(500,60,8)
)

```

# Define DES model inputs
Inputs and variables that will be used in the model are defined below. 
We can define inputs that are common to all patients (`common_all_inputs`) within a simulation, inputs that are unique to a patient independently of the treatment (e.g. natural death, defined in `common_pt_inputs`), and inputs that are unique to that patient and that treatment (`unique_pt_inputs`). Items can be included through the `add_item` function, and can be used in subsequent items. All these inputs are generated before the events and the reaction to events are executed. Furthermore, the program first executes `common_all_inputs`, then `common_pt_inputs` and then `unique_pt_inputs`. So one could use the items generated in `common_all_inputs` in `unique_pt_inputs`.

```{r inputs, message=FALSE}

#Define variables that do not change on any patient or intervention loop
common_all_inputs <- add_item( 
  #Parameters from the survival models
  OS.scale = as.numeric(OS.fit$coef[2]),
  OS.shape = as.numeric(OS.fit$coef[1]),
  OS.coef.int = as.numeric(OS.fit$coef[3]), #Intervention effect

  TTP.scale = as.numeric(TTP.fit$coef[2]),
  TTP.shape = as.numeric(TTP.fit$coef[1]),
  TTP.coef.int = as.numeric(TTP.fit$coef[3]), #Intervention effect
  
  #Utilities
  util.PFS = 0.6, #Utility while in progression-free state
  util.PPS = 0.4, #Utility while in progressed state
  disutil.PAE = -0.02, #One-off disutility of progression-accelerating event

  #Costs
  cost.drug.int = 85000, #Annual intervention cost
  cost.drug.ref = 29000, #Annual cost of reference treatment
  cost.admin.SC = 150, #Unit cost for each SC administration
  cost.admin.oral = 300, #One-off cost for oral administration
  cost.dm.PFS = 3000, #Annual disease-management cost in progression-free state
  cost.dm.PPS = 5000, #Annual disease-management cost in progressed state
  cost.ae.int = 2200, #Annual adverse event costs for intervention
  cost.ae.ref = 1400, #Annual adverse event costs for reference treatment
    )


#Define variables that do not change as we loop through interventions for a patient
common_pt_inputs <- add_item(
  #Patient baseline characteristics
  Sex = as.numeric(IPD[i,"SEX"]), #Record sex of individual patient. 0 = Female; 1 =Male
  BLAge = as.numeric(IPD[i,"AGE"]), #Record patient age at baseline
  
  #Draw time to non-disease related death from a restricted Gompertz distribution
  nat.death = draw_resgompertz(1,shape=if(Sex==1){0.102}else{0.115},
                               rate=if(Sex==1){0.000016}else{0.0000041},
                               lower_bound = BLAge) # Baseline Age in years
  )


#Define variables that change as we loop through treatments for each patient.
unique_pt_inputs <- add_item(
  fl.int  = 0, #Flag to determine if patient is on intervention. Initialized as 0, but will be changed to current arm in the Start event.
  fl.prog = 0, #Flag to determine if patient has progressed. All patients start progression-free
  fl.ontx = 1, #Flag to determine if patient is on treatment. All patients start on treatment
  fl.PAE = 0,  #Flag to determine if progression-accelerating event occurred
  pfs.time = NA #Recording of time at progression
)

```


# Events
## Add Initial Events
We define now the possible events that can occur for the intervention and reference arm respectively using the `add_tte()` function. Only patients in the intervention arm can have a treatment discontinuation, while patients in both arms can have a progression, progression-accelerating and death event.
The seed argument is being used in the `draw_tte()` function which uses the `i` item to ensure that event times specific to each patient can be replicated and updated at later time points.

```{r model_evts}
init_event_list <- 
  #Events applicable to intervention
  add_tte(trt="int",
          evts = c("Start",
                   "TxDisc",
                   "Progression",
                   "PAE",
                   "Death"),
               input={
    Start <- 0
    Progression <- draw_tte(1,'weibull',coef1=TTP.shape, coef2= TTP.scale + TTP.coef.int,seed = as.numeric(paste0(1,i,simulation)))
    TxDisc <- Inf #Treatment discontinuation will occur at progression
    Death <- min(draw_tte(1,'weibull',coef1=OS.shape, coef2= OS.scale + OS.coef.int, seed = as.numeric(paste0(42,i,simulation))), nat.death) #Death occurs at earliest of disease-related death or non-disease-related death
    PAE <- draw_tte(1,'exp',coef1=-log(1-0.05)) #Occurrence of the progression-accelerating event has a 5% probability for the intervention arm
  }) %>%  
  
  #Events applicable to reference treatment
  add_tte(trt="ref",
          evts = c("Start", #Events are the same except that there will be no treatment discontinuation
                   "Progression",
                   "PAE",
                   "Death"),
               input={
    Start <- 0
    Progression <- draw_tte(1,'weibull',coef1=TTP.shape, coef2= TTP.scale,seed = as.numeric(paste0(1,i,simulation)))
    Death <- min(draw_tte(1,'weibull', coef1=OS.shape, coef2= OS.scale, seed = as.numeric(paste0(42,i,simulation))), nat.death) #Death occurs at earliest of disease-related death or non-disease-related death
    PAE <- draw_tte(1,'exp',coef1=-log(1-0.15)) #Occurrence of the progression-accelerating event has a 15% probability for the reference arm
  })

```

## Add Event Reactions
Reactions for each individual event are defined in the following using the `add_reactevt()` function. Patients in the intervention arm discontinue treatment at progression. Occurrence of the progression-accelerated event results in an earlier progression (if it has not occurred yet). Note the use of the seed argument in the `draw_tte()` function which ensures that the same seed is being used in the original and the updated draw of the time to progression.

```{r model_reaction}

evt_react_list <-
  add_reactevt(name_evt = "Start",
               input = {
                 modify_item(list(fl.int = ifelse(trt=="int",1,0)))
               }) %>%
  add_reactevt(name_evt = "TxDisc",
               input = {
                 modify_item(list("fl.ontx"= 0))
               }) %>%
  add_reactevt(name_evt = "Progression",
               input = {
                 modify_item(list("pfs.time"=curtime,"fl.prog"= 1))
                 if(trt=="int"){modify_event(list("TxDisc" = curtime))} #Trigger treatment discontinuation at progression
               }) %>%
  add_reactevt(name_evt = "Death",
               input = {
                 modify_item(list("curtime"=Inf)) 
               }) %>%
  add_reactevt(name_evt = "PAE",
               input = {
                 modify_item(list("fl.PAE"= 1))
                 
                 if(fl.prog == 0){ #Event only accelerates progression if progression has not occurred yet
                 modify_event(list(
                   "Progression"=max(draw_tte(1,'weibull',coef1=TTP.shape, coef2= TTP.scale + TTP.coef.int*fl.int, hr = 1.2, seed = as.numeric(paste0(1,i,simulation))),curtime))) #Occurrence of event accelerates progression by a factor of 1.2
                 }
               })


```

# Costs and Utilities
Costs and utilities are introduced below.

## Utilities
Utilities relating to progression-free and progressed states are common across arms.

```{r utilities}

util_ongoing <- add_util(evt = c("Start","TxDisc","Progression","Death","PAE"),
                              trt = c("int", "ref"), #common utility across arms
                              util = ifelse(fl.prog == 0, util.PFS, util.PPS)
)

util_instant <- add_util(evt = c("PAE"),
                              trt = c("int", "ref"), #common utility across arms
                              util = disutil.PAE
)

```

## Costs
Costs are defined specific to each arm due to differences in drug, administration and AE costs. A one-off cost for oral administration of the reference arm is also applied.

```{r costs}

cost_ongoing <-
  #Drug costs are specific to each arm
  add_cost(
    evt = c("Start","TxDisc","Progression","Death","PAE"),
    trt = "int",
    cost = (cost.drug.int + 
            cost.admin.SC * 12 + #Intervention is administered once a month
            cost.ae.int) * fl.ontx +
           ifelse(fl.prog == 0,cost.dm.PFS,cost.dm.PPS)
      ) %>%
    add_cost(
    evt = c("Start","TxDisc","Progression","Death","PAE"),
    trt = "ref",
    cost = cost.drug.ref + cost.ae.ref + #No ongoing administration cost as reference treatment is oral
      ifelse(fl.prog == 0,cost.dm.PFS,cost.dm.PPS)
    )

#One-off cost only applies to oral administration of reference treatment, applied at start of treatment
cost_instant <-  add_cost(
  evt = "Start",
  trt = "ref",
  cost = cost.admin.oral
)

```


# Model
## Model Execution
The model is executed with the event reactions and inputs previously defined for each patient in the simulated data set.

```{r model_run}
#Logic is: per patient, per intervention, per event, react to that event.
results <- RunSim(  
  npats=as.numeric(nrow(IPD)),              # Simulating the number of patients for which we have IPD
  n_sim=1,                                  # We run all patients once (per treatment)
  psa_bool = FALSE,                         # No PSA for this example
  trt_list = c("int", "ref"),             
  common_all_inputs = common_all_inputs,    
  common_pt_inputs = common_pt_inputs,      
  unique_pt_inputs = unique_pt_inputs,      
  init_event_list = init_event_list,        
  evt_react_list = evt_react_list,          
  util_ongoing_list = util_ongoing,
  cost_ongoing_list = cost_ongoing,
  cost_instant_list = cost_instant,
  ncores = 2,                              
  drc = 0.035,                              # discount rate for costs
  drq = 0.035,                              # discount rate for QALYs
  input_out = c("BLAge","Sex","nat.death","pfs.time")
)
```

# Post-processing of Model Outputs
## Summary of Results

Once the model has been run, we can use the results and summarize them using the `summary_results_det` to print the results of the deterministic case. The individual patient data generated by the simulation is recorded in the `psa_ipd` object. 

```{r post-processing_summary}

summary_results_det(results$final_output) #will print the last simulation!

psa_ipd <- bind_rows(map(results$output_psa, "merged_df")) 

psa_ipd[1:10,] %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))


```

We can also check what has been the absolute number of events per strategy.

```{r post-processing_analysis,echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

psa_ipd %>% group_by(trt,evtname) %>% summarise(n=n()) %>% arrange(trt,-n)%>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive"))

```

## Plots
We now use the simulation output to plot the Kaplan-Meier curves of the simulated OS and PFS against the observed Kaplan-Meier curves.
The simulated progression-free survival curve is lower than the observed due to the addition of the progression-accelerating event into the model.

```{r post-processing_plots1, fig.width=7, fig.height=4, fig.align = 'center', warning = FALSE}
